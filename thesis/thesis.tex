\chapter*{Abstract}
The number of performed flights by global airline industries increased from 23.8 million flights (2004)
to 38.9 million flights (2019)\cite{STATISTA}. This growing number of performed flights puts an enormous
pressure on the global aviation industry as a whole. The permanent price pressure lead to demands of
cheaper, lighter and smaller flight components\cite{prisaznuk1992integrated}. Every inch and every gramm 
counts in the global business of civil aviation, because every inch less means one possible paying customer 
more on the plane and every gramm less means less expensive fuel demands for the flight. As a result
the aviation industry has been actively searching for solutions for the aforementioned problems.
The ongoing digitalization brought different ideas for technological improvements in the aviation sector.
One of these technologies is \gls{ima}. \gls{ima} promises a price, space and weight cut, leading to more 
space and weight for customers, goods or other equipment (for example weapon payload in the military sector)
via using fewer, more centralized processing units. The aim of this master thesis is the exploration
of the idea behind \gls{ima} and analyzing its challenges.
