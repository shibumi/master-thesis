\chapter*{Abstract}
The number of performed flights by global airline industries increased from 23.8 million flights (2004)
to 38.9 million flights (2019)\cite{STATISTA}. This growing number of performed flights puts an enormous
pressure on the global aviation industry as a whole. The permanent price pressure lead to demands of
cheaper, lighter and smaller flight components\cite{prisaznuk1992integrated}. Every inch and every gramm 
counts in the global business of civil aviation, because every inch less means one possible paying customer 
more on the plane and every gramm less means less expensive fuel demands for the flight. As a result
the aviation industry has been actively searching for solutions for the aforementioned problems.
The ongoing digitalization brought different ideas for technological improvements in the aviation sector.
This master thesis aims to highlight the main problems and a few of these ideas. Furthermore
it tries to find related problems in other areas of computer science and tries to connect these
problems with their possible solutions with the known problems in the aviation industry. The ultimate
goal of this thesis is to provide alternative research to the existing proposed solutions for the explored
problems in the flight industry.

\chapter{Integrated Modular Avionics}

One of these technologies is \gls{ima}. \gls{ima} promises a price, space and weight cut, leading to more 
space and weight for customers, goods or other equipment (for example weapon payload in the military sector)
via using fewer, more centralized processing units. The aim of this master thesis is the exploration
of the concepts and challenges behind \gls{ima} and comparing it to existing solutions from the new forming
Cloud-Native initiative driven by cloud companies.
